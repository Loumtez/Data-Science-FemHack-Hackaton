Data Science FemHack challenge using AI to analyze the various petitions on Change.org and predict their likelihood of success.

### :pushpin: About the project:
This project was developed for **Data Science FemHack Hackaton Vol. II**. The aim is to use AI to analyze the various petitions on Change.org and predict their likelihood of success. A responsible AI and data science could create a real impact, so the solutions could help shape the future of social activism and responsible use of AI.

### :pushpin: Files:
- ChangeOrg_Hackaton.ipynb file: file with the code used in this challenge.
- train and test .csv files: train.csv and test.csv, one to train the classification model and another one to predict the success of the petitions with the trained model, to generate the predictions file.
- predictions.csv file: the prediction file with the "test_idx" column for petition identification and the column "victory_falg_prediction" with the result. The number 0 is for a dismissed petition and 1 for a sucessful petition.
